This CD is compressed as a set of SquashFS images. To access its contents:

  * You may add SquashFS support to your existing system (GoboLinux kernel has
    this support by default) and then mount the desired image:
    $ mount -o loop -t squashfs /Mount/CD-ROM/Packages-List-Base.squashfs /Mount/SquashFS

  * Alternatively, you may boot from the CD.  This uses the ISOLINUX
    bootloader.

  * In addition, you can help test the LiveFlash option.  Please see
    README.USB for more information.  The LiveFlash is currently in beta
    and has received limited testing.  This uses the SYSLINUX bootloader.
